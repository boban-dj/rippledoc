If you're not sure where to begin, do this:

~~~
cd my-project
mkdir doc
cd doc
touch index.md tutorial.md examples.md news.md
~~~

**index.md** should be your project's overview. Explain what your
project is, what it does, and why folks would want to use it.  If your
../README.md contains substantial overview material, move that
material into index.md.  index.md is the "front page" of your
project's docs.

**tutorial.md** can for now just be a walkthrough: detailed
instructions, start to finish, on how to use some basic features of
your project.

**examples.md**. Be sure to use syntax highlighting for your code
snippets. If you have a lot of examples, skip the examples.md file and
instead create an examples *directory* which you can then populate with
*this-feature*.md and *that-feature*.md files.

**news.md** should include version numbers and dates, and summarize
user-facing changes. If readers are interested in seeing individual
*code* changes, they can always look at the version control logs.

Other ideas for documents you (or potential contributors) might
write:

  * cheatsheet.md
  * quick-ref.md
  * manual.md
  * reference.md (though, for software, this is often taken
    care of by autogenerated API docs)
